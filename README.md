A Quick PowerShell Reference for Commands and Associated Aliases.

I wrote this after learning more about the commands for Windows Batch Scripting as CMD Gloss, and thought it interesting to build something similar to PowerShell. I should note that these are all commands and aliases in a brand-new session, in which nothing has yet been imported, but I might add some more at a later date.

This code has no license, all I ask is that it is used responsibly. "Don't be evil" with it.
